<p>
I thought the earth<br/>
remembered me, she<br/>
took me back so tenderly, arranging<br/>
her dark skirts, her pockets<br/>
full of lichens and seeds. I slept<br/>
as never before, a stone<br/>
on the riverbed, nothing<br/>
between me and the white fire of the stars<br/>
but my thoughts among the branches<br/>
of the perfect trees. </p>

<p>All night<br/>
I heard the small kingdoms breathing<br/>
around me, the insects, and the birds<br/>
who do their work in the darkness. </p>

<p>All night<br/>
I rose and fell as if in water, grappling<br/>
with a luminous doom. By morning<br/>
I had vanished at least a dozen times<br/>
into something better.</p>
